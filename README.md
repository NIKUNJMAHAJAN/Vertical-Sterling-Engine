# Vertical Stirling Engine â€“ SolidWorks Project

This repository contains the complete machine drawing and 3D CAD model of a **Vertical Stirling Engine**, created using **SolidWorks**. The project demonstrates mechanical design skills and an understanding of thermal engines, suitable for academic or prototyping purposes.

---

## Project Overview

A **Stirling Engine** is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine that operates through cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas at different temperatures. This project specifically focuses on the **Vertical configuration** of the engine.

The model includes:
- Piston-Cylinder Assembly
- Flywheel and Crankshaft Mechanism
- Displacer Cylinder and Linkages
- Bearings and Base Frame
- Fasteners and Motion Simulation Setup
