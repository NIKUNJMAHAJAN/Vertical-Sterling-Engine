# Vertical Stirling Engine ‚Äì SolidWorks Project

This repository contains the complete machine drawing and 3D CAD model of a **Vertical Stirling Engine**, created using **SolidWorks**. The project demonstrates mechanical design skills and an understanding of thermal engines, suitable for academic or prototyping purposes.

---

## Project Overview

A **Stirling Engine** is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine that operates through cyclic compression and expansion of air or other gas at different temperatures. This project specifically focuses on the **Vertical configuration** of the engine.

The model includes:
- Piston-Cylinder Assembly
- Flywheel and Crankshaft Mechanism
- Displacer Cylinder and Linkages
- Bearings and Base Frame
- Fasteners and Motion Simulation Setup

## Tools Used

- **Software**: SolidWorks 2023
- **Modules**: Part Modelling, Assembly, Engineering Drawings, Motion Study
- **Render Engine**: SolidWorks Visualize (optional)

## üñºÔ∏è Highlights

- **Fully Constrained Assembly**
- **Exploded Views with Bill of Materials (BOM)**
- **Motion Analysis Setup (crank rotation and piston movement)**
- **Drawing Sheets with Dimensions and Tolerances**
- Realistic renders for presentation/documentation

---

## Applications

- Educational Demonstrations (Thermodynamics & Mechanism Design)
- Prototyping basis for functional Stirling Engines
- Portfolio and resume projects for mechanical/CAD roles
